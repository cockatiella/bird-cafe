        Our birds are fully tamed and hand fed, very friendly and socialized, got
        a pretty good vocabulary, excellent at voice commands and are great with
        kids and other birds. They were raised with much love and socialization to
        help you get the best family companions.

        <h2>Lovebirds</h2>
        <p>
          Lovebirds are native to Africa and the island of Madagascar. They are
          small parrots that are named for the strong pair bonds they form with
          their chosen mate. Lovebirds are a popular pet bird, but their small
          size and active nature can make them a challenging pet for many
          people.
